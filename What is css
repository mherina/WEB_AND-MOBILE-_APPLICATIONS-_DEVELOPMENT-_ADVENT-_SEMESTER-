What is CSS?

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a fundamental language used to style web pages.
It separates the presentation of a document (fonts, colors, layout, etc.) from its content (HTML).
This separation makes web development more efficient, maintainable, and allows for consistent styling across different pages.

Why is CSS important?

Separation of Concerns: Keeps HTML focused on content and CSS focused on presentation, making code easier to manage.
Consistent Styling: Applying the same styles across multiple pages saves time and ensures a cohesive look.
Responsiveness: CSS allows you to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes, making your website accessible on various devices.
Visual Appeal: CSS enables you to create stunning designs with various fonts, colors, layouts, and effects.
Basic Structure of CSS:

CSS consists of three main components:

Selectors: Target the HTML elements you want to style.
Properties: Define the specific styles you want to apply.
Values: Set the desired values for each property.
